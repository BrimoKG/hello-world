# hello-world
this is the first step of a big story
I'm a beginner in programming for Mali, a country xhere programming is not really developed. 
it's not easy to learn programming in Mali, because you must do all it by your own. I mean there
is a few good progrmmer in our country. Even those which I'm calling good programmers are not so good enough.
